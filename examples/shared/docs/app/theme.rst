LOOT's user interface has CSS theming support. A dark theme is provided with LOOT: to use it, select it in the Theme dropdown in LOOT's settings dialog.

Themes are installed in the ``resources/ui/css`` directory, relative to ``LOOT.exe``. Theme CSS files must be named ``<theme name>.theme.css`` to be detected as such by LOOT. A working knowledge of CSS is required to create new themes, though the provided dark theme CSS file is commented to provide some assistance.
